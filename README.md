# Creating-Customer-Segments-Project


In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor to identify customer segments hidden in the data.

Here, I first explore the data to determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another by observing a small subset of the data and also by plotting a scatter matrix. Afterward, I preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) 
unwanted outliers. Then I apply PCA transformations to the data and implement a clustering algorithm (GK-Means clustering algorithm)to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
